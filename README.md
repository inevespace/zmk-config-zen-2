ZMK config for corne-ish 3x6 with epaper display and RGB. The key matrix is same as normal corne.

Utilize layout with many vertical combo to uliminate stretching index finger to central column. 
In order to us such layout comfortably, you need keycaps that allow pressing two veritcal neigbor keys comfortably. In my case I just rotated upper layer of keycaps. It created a concaved surface for fingers, wiere lowest point is between two rows. It allows to use finger placment as on stenography keyboard, and pressing combo is very easy.
